## FAQ

### Can I do other things on my machine while the script runs?
No.  The script will move the mouse and send simulated clicks/keystrokes.  If you move the mouse or try to use your computer while the script is running, you will interfere with the script and the script will interfere with what you are doing.

### Does it work in all tiers?
No.  It won't work above Gold because it's only programmed to be able to select 5 champions.  Once I get to Gold, I will fix this.

### Will I get banned if I use it?
I don't know.

### Can the script intelligently ban/pick the right champions?
No.

### Can the script intelligently play the battle for me?
No.  All battles are run on full auto.

### What platforms are supported?
Windows only.

### Why isn't it working?
It uses UI automation, which is a brittle programming technique, and I've only ever been able to test it on my own machine.
